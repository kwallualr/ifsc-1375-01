        <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Web Accessibility means making your website easier for people with disabilities.  It is important to build accessible websites because
            absolutely anybody would be able to use your website.  Blind people and people who have mobility problems would be able to access
            to work through your website.
