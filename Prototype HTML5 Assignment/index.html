        <p><strong>Tesla</strong> is a company that creates cars that are <q><em>completely electric</em></q>.
          Tesla cars help the environment because you don't use gas to keep them running.
          Tesla cars have autopilot on every car.  The autopilot the car comes
          with will just drive your car in one lane.  You can buy a better autopilot
          that will change lanes for you and more.  Tesla's have different features in the cars.
          There is a setting that allows you to leave your animals in a fully air conditioned car 
          while still remaining to be locked.  You can play all sorts of games and you get access 
          to all sorts of apps. </p>

          <h3>Model Descriptions</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt><strong>Model 3</strong></dt>
            <dd>The Model 3 is the cheapest Tesla. It is a pretty average car.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Model S</strong></dt>
            <dd>The Model S is the second fastest Tesla.  It is very sleak and looks very nice.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Model X</strong></dt>
            <dd>The Model X is one of the SUV type Teslas.  The Model X has falcon wings and is fast for a SUV.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Model Y</strong></dt>
            <dd>The Model Y is the cheapest SUV.  It is pretty average for an SUV.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Roadster</strong></dt>
            <dd>The Roadster is the fastest vehicle.  I think it could be considered a supercar.</dd>
          <dt><strong>Cybertruck</strong></dt>
          <dd>The Cybertruck is a truck.  More of an SUV, but a truck nonetheless.  It is supposed to be unbreakable, but it has yet to come out.</dd>

          <h3>Ranked List (in my opinion)</h3>
          <ol start="1">
            <li>Roadster - it is a fast car and sleak</li>
            <li>Model S - it is the second fastest car and looks really nice</li>
            <li>Cybertruck - it is kind of ugly, but I dig it</li>
            <li>Model X - it has falcon wings and is still fast</li>
            <li>Model Y - it is brand new and it is very spacious</li>
            <li>Model 3 - it is the cheapest and very common</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Quote from Elon Musk</h4>
          <blockquote>I always have optimism, but I'm realistic.
            It was not with the expectation of great success that I started
            Tesla or SpaceX... It's just that I thought they were important enough to do anyway.
